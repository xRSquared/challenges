# Challenge to create an interpreter in Rust

In this challenge I will create an interpreter in Rust following the
book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

## Lexer (Tokenizer)

Transforming, from source code to tokens, is called “lexical analysis”, or “lexing” for
short.
